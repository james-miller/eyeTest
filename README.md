A matchers library for automated tests of iOS applications using the Apple UIAutomation instrument

Installation 
------------

The easiest way to use eyeTest is to clone this repo locally and periodically pull updates. Using Finder, drag and drop `eyeTestMatchers.js` into the `AppNameTests/Supporting Files` directory within your Xcode project.

Usage
-----

Create a new `.js` file within `AppNameTests`. This will be where you write the tests. You need to include the matcher set by adding `#import "eyeTestMatchers.js"` at the top of your code, and then you should be good to go!

Contributions
-------------

Contributions to the matcher set are always welcomed - please feel free to submit pull requests.
